# vagrant-ubuntu-xenial64
A Vagrantfile and provisioning script to setup a Vagrant box with the latest Git, Node, and MongoDB on Ubuntu 16.04.

Requires [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

I also recommend [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) to insure that your guest additions get updated properly.

## After installing vagrant

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

## Setup

Copy `Vagrantfile` to the directory you want to share with and run the Vagrant box from.

Open the directory in your terminal, console or command line.

```
$ Vagrant Up
```

Once your Vagrant box is booted and has completed provisioning:

```
$ vagrant ssh
```

This will log you into your vagrant box.

The bootstrap.sh provisioning script will make sure the latest versions of git, nodejs, and mongoDB are installed, including setting up proper permissions for Mongo and NPM.

Open your shared folder within your vagrant box, where you can perform or run anything that you would normally in an Ubuntu 16.04 bash terminal:

```
ubuntu@ ~ $ cd /vagrant/
```

## Managing Your Vagrant Box

Your host machine terminal is used to manage your Vagrant box guest.

To reboot:

```
$ vagrant reload
```

To reboot and provision or re-provision:

```
$ vagrant reload --provision
```

To suspend:

```
$ vagrant suspend
```

To shutdown (halt):

```
$ vagrant halt
```

To remove the virtual machine completely:

```
$ vagrant destroy
```
